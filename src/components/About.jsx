        <p className='text-xl text-gray-600'>Hi! I'm Ishika, a second-year Computer Science student with a passion for web development and AI.
           I'm currently exploring backend technologies like Django and NodeJS. I’ve built several personal projects including this portfolio using frontend technologies.
           I’m enthusiastic about creating meaningful projects and problem solving and am always open to learning new tools and technologies. I'm also seeking internship opportunities to grow as a developer and contribute to real-world projects.
            Outside of tech, I enjoy sketching and listening music.
