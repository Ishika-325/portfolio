        <p className='text-xl text-gray-600'>Hi! I'm Anvika, a second-year Computer Science student with a passion for web development and UI/UX design.
           I'm currently exploring frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React and Tailwind CSS. I’ve built several personal projects including this portfolio, and I'm currently working on an AI-powered resume analyzer.
           I’m enthusiastic about creating meaningful user experiences and am always open to learning new tools and technologies. I'm also seeking internship opportunities to grow as a developer and contribute to real-world projects.
            Outside of tech, I enjoy sketching and getting inspired by creative designs on platforms like Dribbble and Pinterest.
